# Rust Template

My template for Rust projects.

## ðŸª„ Features

### ðŸ“¦ Automatic Releases

When a tag starting with `v` is pushed to the repository, the `tagged-release` workflow will be triggered, which will:

- Create a release on GitHub
- Run `cargo test` to ensure the code is working
- Build the project binary in release mode, for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Upload the binaries to the release
- Publish the crate to crates.io

### ðŸ¤– Justfile

> [!NOTE]
> This section assumes that you're developing on Linux, and have [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) installed.

Provides a few handy commands, including:

- `just b`/`just build`: Build the release binary
- `just r`/`just run`: Compile and run the project
- `just t`/`just test`: Run tests
- `just v`/`just version`: Set or get version

The `just v` command, without additional arguments, will print the current version of the project. If a version is provided, e.g. `just v 0.1.1`, it will set the version to `0.1.1`. To be specific, it will:

1. Update `version` in `Cargo.toml`
2. Update `Cargo.lock` (`cargo update`)
3. Add and commit changes (signed), with message `Bump version to v0.1.1`
4. Tag the commit with `v0.1.1` (signed)

You can then push the commit and tag to the remote repository, which will trigger the `tagged-release` workflow.

### ðŸ“– Template Documentation & Code

- `README.md`: The README file, including:
    - Badges for license, workflow status, release, downloads, crates.io version and downloads, and docs.rs
    - Project name and description
    - Installation instructions
    - Examples, usage and credits (you can fill these in later, or remove them)
- `LICENSE`: The MIT License, with your username filled in
- `Cargo.toml`: The Cargo manifest file, with relevant fields filled in
    - Supporting `cargo-binstall` out of the box
    - Various optimizations for release builds
- `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs` and `tests/integration_test.rs`: The main library, binary and integration test, with an example `add` function

## ðŸ¤” Usage

### âœ¨ Creating a New Project

1. [Setup `cargo-generate`](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/#installation) on your machine.
2. Run the following command to create a new project from this template:

    ```bash
    cargo generate PRO-2684/rust-template
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to set up your project. You'll be asked for:

   - Project name (`project-name`)
   - Project description (`project-description`)

    Your [username](https://cargo-generate.github.io/cargo-generate/templates/builtin_placeholders.html?highlight=username) will be automatically determined by `cargo-generate`.

4. After the project is generated, consider filling (or commenting) out `keywords` and `categories` in `Cargo.toml`.
5. In order for [automatic releases](#-automatic-releases) to work, you need to follow the steps in *Automatic Releases Setup* section in the **generated** `README.md` file.

An example project can be found [here](https://github.com/PRO-2684/rust-template-example).

### âž• On an Existing Project

Currently you'll have to copy and modify the files manually. Here's a list of files that might be useful:

- [`release.yml`](./template/.github/workflows/release.yml): The GitHub Actions workflow for automatic releases
- [`justfile`](./template/justfile): The `just` config file for handy commands
- [`README.md`](./template/README.md): The README file, including badges and project description

You have to replace `{{project-name}}` & `{{project-description}}` accordingly, and remove `{% raw %}` & `{% endraw %}` template tags.

## âœ… TODO

- [x] Showcase an example project generated using this template
    - [ ] Auto sync with this template using GitHub Actions
- [ ] Allow for specifying crate type
    - [ ] `bin`: Only `main.rs` will be generated (default, when `--bin` flag is used)
    - [ ] `lib`: Only `lib.rs` will be generated (when `--lib` flag is used)
    - [ ] `mixed`: Both `main.rs` and `lib.rs` will be generated (current, how to specify this?)
    - Workspace not planned yet
- [ ] Generate `cli` feature, if the crate type is `mixed`
- [ ] Allow for specifying whether to sign commits and tags
- [ ] Allow for multiple binaries and their `name` fields
